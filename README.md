This project represents my solution for the Results Summary Component challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a results summary component that showcases key metrics or data in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## Overview

The Results Summary Component challenge focused on building a visually appealing and organized component that presents important metrics or data in a concise format. The goal was to create a design that effectively communicates the summarized results to the users.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create a visually appealing summary component that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

By leveraging CSS techniques, I aimed to enhance the design with attention to detail, ensuring that the metrics and data are presented in a clear and visually engaging manner. The component should effectively summarize the key information and provide an easy-to-understand snapshot of the results.
